# CodeIgniter MongoDB Library
This library was created because of the lack of worthy alternatives. The solutions already existing at the time of development were either obsolete or had too weak functional capabilities. I decided to fix the problem and give you a modern and multifunctional library for working with MongoDB in CodeIgniter. Now you can almost anything that MongoDB can out of the box.

**Requirements:**
* PHP 7.1+, PECL extension
* CodeIgniter 3+
* MongoDB 3.2+

If you have ideas for improving the library, I'm ready to listen to suggestions ([#support](#support))!

## Features
This library supports the following features:
* Write Concern and Journal.
* Read Preference and Concern.
* Bulk Write.
* Driver options.
* A huge number of query options for Select, Insert, Update, Delete and Aggregation.
* Execute commands at the database level.
* Output of documents as objects or arrays.
* Extensive connectivity configuration options.

## Start
To work with the library, see [Wiki](https://github.com/verkhoumov/codeigniter-mongodb-library/wiki), where you can find all available methods and examples of it use.

## Support
To report a problem or error, and to suggest the implementation of new features, use [issue tracker](https://github.com/verkhoumov/codeigniter-mongodb-library/issues). There you can ask questions and ask for help. I will be glad to any help!
